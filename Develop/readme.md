I have created a random password generator using JavaScript to help with the process. 
The generator automatically creates a password with specific needs of the user. You can choose the password length you desire along with any lower and upper cased letters. Additionally, you as the user, have options to add special characters and/or numeric values. 
This is a fun easy way to help create passwords for users. The link is below, please feel free to give it a try.
